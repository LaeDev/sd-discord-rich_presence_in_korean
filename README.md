<p align="center">Hey!<br>Let me tell you about this awesome extension we've been working on.<br>Designed for AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI.<br>It connects your status to Discord's rich presence.<br><br>What does that mean, you ask?<br><br>Well, it basically shows your Discord friends<br>what you're up to with Stable Diffusion.<br><br>One of the coolest features of this extension is that it can<br>automatically detect what Stable Diffusion model you're using.<br>And if you're not generating any images, it sets your status to "Idle".<br><br>But the real magic happens when you start generating images.<br>The extension will broadcast the total number of images being generated,<br>so your friends can see just how productive you're being.</p>
